                                            While-Loops
Now to totally blow your mind with a new loo—the while-loop. A while-loop will keep executing the code block under it as long as a Boolean expression is True.
Wait, you have been keeping up with the terminology, right? That if we write a line and end it with a : (colon), then that tells python to start new block of code? Then we indent and that’s the new code. This is all about structuring your program so that Python know that what you mean. If you do not get that idea, then go back and do some more work with if-statements, functions, and for-loop until you get it.

Later on, we’ll have some exercises that will train your brain to read this structures, similar to how we burned Boolean expression in your brain.

Back to while-loops. What they do is simply do a test like an if-statement, but instead of running the code block once, they jump back to the “top” where the while is and repeat. It keeps doing this until the expression is False. 
Here’s the problem with while-loops.: Sometimes they do not stop. This is great if your intention is to just keep looping until the end of the universe. Otherwise you almost always want your loops to end eventually.
